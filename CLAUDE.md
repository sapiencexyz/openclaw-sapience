When modifying files in this repo:

1. **Pre-mortem** - Before finalizing, ask: "If I were an LLM agent reading this, what would confuse me? What would I get wrong?"

2. **Fix gaps** - Address issues before committing.

3. **Test mentally** - Walk through: read skill → attempt task → hit edge case. Is it covered?

4. **No slop** - No unnecessary comments or over-explanation. Match existing voice.

5. **Multi-leg only** - Sapience requires 2+ legs per prediction. No single-market bets.
